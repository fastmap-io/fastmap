# Fastmap CHANGELOG

## [0.0.10] - 2021-07-12
Several tweaks/fixes over the past few versions for test users

## [0.0.7] - 2021-07-01
Major paradigm change. Fastmap is now oriented around a controller/worker approach.
Map is still in dev. Unit tests have no chance. But this should work for
some basic offload usage.
